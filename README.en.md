## 📌 Summary  
Given the current state of society, technology has played a crucial role in enabling the operation of various sectors such as communication, learning, entertainment, product deliveries, and food services. In this context of social distancing, the creation of a mobile application was considered. This app aims to integrate independent merchants into the remote commerce ecosystem while also expanding their reach to consumers.  

The goal of this application is to streamline the delivery process, making orders more dynamic and simplified through the ease of smartphone and app usage. Additionally, its functionality is not limited to independent business owners, but also assists app users by providing information on deliveries and available promotions. Other features include user registration, order management, promotional discounts, and delivery tracking. Furthermore, business owners can generate reports containing sales information, allowing for better decision-making and business orientation.
